                Deceptive Defender is a modular framework for an extension, designed to identify and combat (e.g. highlight or neutralize) deceptive patterns on websites. 
                It serves as a foundation for attaching a detector for detecting the pattern instances and a converter for choosing the countermeasure.

                Deceptive Patterns are designs that influence the decision making of the user. The user get's manipulated into taking actions, they wouldn't have taken if they were fully informed and confronted with a neutral design.

                    <p>Confirmshaming works by triggering uncomfortable emotions, such as guilt or shame, to influence users' decision-making. 
                        Websites or apps employing this deceptive pattern often present users with opt-out button labels that are worded in a derogatory or belittling manner, 
                        making users feel bad about choosing not to engage with the offered service or feature. 
                        By targeting users' emotions and self-image, confirmshaming aims to increase the likelihood that users will give in to the desired action, ultimately benefiting the service provider.</p>

                    <p>There are numerous ways to interfere with the visual design of a page to hide, obscure, or disguise information. 
                        Visual perception can be manipulated by using small, low-contrast text. Comprehension can be manipulated by creating a chaotic or overwhelming interface. 
                        Users' expectations can be violated by placing important information in styles or locations they would not expect.
